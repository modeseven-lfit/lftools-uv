  # Enable caching for improved performance
  # expiration_time: 3600  # Cache for 1 hour
  # max_age: 3600

# Notes:
# - Replace all 'your-*' placeholders with actual credentials
# - Application credentials are recommended over username/password for automation
# - To create application credentials: OpenStack Dashboard > Identity > Application Credentials
# - Region names vary by cloud provider (common: RegionOne, us-east-1, etc.)
# - Set verify: false only for development with self-signed certificates
# - Multiple regions can be configured by duplicating clouds with different region_name
# - Interface options: public, internal, admin (public is most common)
